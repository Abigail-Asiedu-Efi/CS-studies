# CS Learning Together

Welcome to our shared computer science learning space!  
We're two siblings exploring a range of CS topics and using this repository to teach each other as we go.

## Our Goal

To strengthen our understanding of computer science by:

- Studying foundational and advanced topics
- Teaching one another through shared notes and projects
- Using Git and GitHub for collaboration and version control
- Practicing with real code and cyber security exercises

## Repository Structure

We organize our content by **topic**, allowing flexibility and deeper dives.

Each topic(folder) may include:

- Notes (Markdown files)
- Code snippets or mini-projects
- Links to helpful resources

## Tools & Workflow

- **Git** for version control
- **GitHub** for sharing and collaboration
- **Markdown** for writing notes
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, Java, and more as we learn

## How We Help Each Other

- Leave comments or questions in code and notes
- Explain what we’ve learned each week
- Provide positive, constructive feedback
- Pair up on difficult topics or mini-projects

Let’s keep learning, building, and having fun
