# Lesson 3: Constants and Math in Go

This lesson demonstrates the use of constants and the `math` package in Go.

## Concepts Covered

- Defining string and numeric constants using `const`
- Basic arithmetic with large numbers
- Type conversion (`float64` to `int64`)
- Using built-in math functions (e.g., `math.Sin()`)


## What the Program Does

1.Prints a string constant.
2.Divides a large float number by a constant and prints the result.
3.Converts the result to an integer and prints it.
4.Uses math.Sin() to compute and print the sine of a constant.

## Code summary
-This Go program demonstrates:
-Declaring constants (string and numeric)
- Performing arithmetic operations with constants
- Using scientific notation (e.g., 9e20)
- Type conversion from float64 to int64
- Using the math package to calculate sine


## How to Run

-Open your terminal
- Navigate to the directory where the file is located:
     cd ~/Desktop/golang/lesson3-constants

- Run using the command:
    go run lesson3-constants.go


## Output
